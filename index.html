<h1>Timothy Isaac Ellinas</h1>
<p> I am a 20 year old sophomore at
<a href="http://www.bju.edu/">Bob Jones University</a>. I am a Bible major with a concentration in Pastoral Studies. I am currently studying online, but I am hoping to become a resident student next semester.
</p>
<p> I have lived in the same house in Georgia for my whole life. Since I live in Georgia, I have certain affections for typical country hoopla (stuff or anything you want it to mean). I love trucks, guns, knives, hunting, and anything that is done outside. I am currently employed at Chick-fil-a and Keen Edge Lawn Care.
</p>
<p> An institution that has a had a great impact on my life is the <a href="http://www.timothygroup.org/">Timothy Group</a>. 
The Timothy Group is a leadership training organization for young men. I had the opportunity to participate in one of their events. At this event, I believe God confirmed that I should attend Bible college.
